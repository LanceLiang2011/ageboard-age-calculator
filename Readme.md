# Frontend Mentor - Age Calculator

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is an implementation of the Age Calculator coding challenge.

## Challenge

This app calculates and displays the age of a user based on the birth date they input. The age is displayed in years, months, and days.

## How to use

The main interface of the application consists of an input form and an AgeBoard component that displays the calculated age.

To use this app:

1. Enter your birth date into the input form.
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. The app will calculate your age and display it on the AgeBoard.

## Built with

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Styled-Components for styling
- Frontend Mentor for the challenge

## Implementation details

The main functionality of the application is contained in the `MainCard` and `AgeBoard` components.

In the `MainCard` component, the user's birth date is managed by the `birth` state variable, and the calculated age is stored in the `age` state variable. The `valid` state variable is used to handle form validation and display error messages.

The `MainCard` component also contains a `handleSubmit` function that is triggered when the form is submitted. This function validates the user's input, calculates the age if the input is valid, and updates the `age` and `valid` state variables accordingly.

The `AgeBoard` component takes the `age` object as a prop and displays the age in years, months, and days.

The helper functions and constants used in the application are defined in the `util.js` file.
